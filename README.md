# IOURS
 Idle Online Universe Runes Solver

Math based on Multicalc v10.0.3

# One level
If you want to check best rune for one specific level, choose 'One level' in Opponent Data Input. A simple message box will give you information about best rune combination and needed heals to win.

# Continuous
If you want to check what runes are best in the long run, choose this option. Showing every combination on the graph will be paintfull, so one best rune per 10 level is calculated and then heal needed for every level is displayed, lower the better ofcourse. So for example if you will see only two lines, you have to choose only between those two combination of runes.
